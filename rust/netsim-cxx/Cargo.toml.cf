# This is the netsim on Cuttlefish Cargo.toml file.
#
# Android.bp rules are used for Cuttlefish rust, but developers may
# want to run clippy using cargo so we also have this Config.toml.cf
#
# We keep two Config files because Cargo fetches all optional
# crates. Some of these crates are not part of the emulator build
# environment.
#
# See:
#
#   https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/4544
#
# Usage:
#
#   cp Cargo.toml.cf Cargo.toml
#   cargo run
#
