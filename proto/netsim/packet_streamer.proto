/**
 * This is the packet service for the network simulator.
 *
 * Android Virtual Devices (AVDs) and accessory devices use this service to
 * connect to the network simulator and pass packets back and forth.
 *
 * AVDs running in a guest VM are built with virtual controllers for each radio
 * chip. These controllers route chip requests to host emulators (qemu and
 * crosvm) using virtio and from there they are forwarded to this gRpc service.
 *
 * This setup provides a transparent radio environment across AVDs and
 * accessories because the network simulator contains libraries to emulate
 * Bluetooth, 80211MAC, UWB, and Rtt chips.
